# Hash Tables Problems

1. Given a list of strings, group the strings into lists of anagrams. Return the groups as a list of lists.
For example, if the input is:
 `["bat", "meta", "tab", "tea", "ate", "tame", "jazz" "eat"]`, the output would be:
  `[["bat", "tab"], ["meta", "tame"], ["tea", "ate", "eat"],["jazz"]]`
<br/>

2. Given a list and a value `k`, return the k most frequently occurring elements. If there is a tie for kth-most frequent, return all the tied elements. If `k` is greater than the numbe of unique elements, return a list of all the unique elements.

3. Given a list of integers and a value `k`, return the number of continuous subarrays that sum to `k`.
For example, if the input is `[1,1,1]` and `k=2`, the output should be `2`.
